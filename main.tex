\chapter{\underline{{INTRODUCTION}}}
\section{Introduction to Training}
THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE - As per survey, the next generation jobs would be for the ones skilled with MLOps (Data Science that Industry needs)\\
\begin{center}
\textbf{\Large{Machine Learning with DevOps - MLOps"}}\\
\textbf{\textit{\large{DataScience that Industry Needs MLOps - Enterprise AI}}}
\end{center}

The \textbf{percentage of AI models} created but never put into production in large enterprises has been estimated to be as much as \textbf{90\% or more.} With massive investments in data science teams, platforms, and infrastructure, the number of AI projects is dramatically increasing — along with the number of missed opportunities.\\Unfortunately, most projects are not showing the value that business leaders expect and are introducing new risks that need to be managed.

\textbf{Solution to the above problem statement is MLOps}. MLOps delivers the capabilities that \textbf{Data Science} \& \textbf{IT Ops} teams need to work together to \textbf{deploy, monitor \& manage} machine learning models in production and to govern their use in production environments.

\section{Background of the company}

\chapter{\underline{DESIGN}}
\section{Architecture Design}
\fontsize{12pt}{10pt}\selectfont
The Architecture Design is very crucial for any software because the design principles, architectural decisions, and their outcome, i.e., software architecture together enable a software system to deliver its’ business, operational, and technical objectives. 
Hence, we first consider following indications for our software architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item The software is easy to maintain;
\item    Business stakeholders can understand it easily;
\item    Good software architectures are usable over the long-term;
\item    Such architecture patterns are flexible, adaptable, and extensible;
\item    It should facilitate scalability;
\item    The team can easily add features, moreover, the system performance doesn’t diminish due to this;
\item    There is no repetition of the code;
\item    The system can be refactored easily.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
We have used the best design patterns according to our need i.e.\\

\newpage
\subsection{Level 0: Automation}
\fontsize{12pt}{10pt}\selectfont
The Machine Learning model design which was traditionally used can be referred from [Figure \ref{fig_level0}]

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Level 0} looks very much like a portfolio or Kaggle project.
\item There is little automation and limited options for data storage.
\item If we wanted to retrain out model, we’d have to repeat all these steps again. This makes dealing with model drift difficult.
\item If we wanted to repeat this with a different data or notebook, we’d have to copy code or adapt a notebook.
\item We need additional tools to track our experiments when creating models.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsection{Level 1: High Automation}
\fontsize{12pt}{10pt}\selectfont
The Machine Learning model design we are using can be referred as \textbf{Level 1: Automation} [Figure \ref{fig_level1}]

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\caption{High Automation MLops}
\label{fig_level1}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The first new item here is a \textbf{feature store}. This is a database specifically for ML features. We do a variety of operations when training models such as scaling, feature engineering, encoding and mathematical transformations. Many of these features are not useful for typical analysis so a feature store allows us to store this and access it more easily.
\item On the left side, we have \textbf{orchestrated} experiments. This is the concept of automation many operations in the Data Science work flow.
\item The red square in the bottom left is the creation of a \textbf{pipeline}. This is another automation. When we deploy as pipeline, we are deploying the model and the transformations required to generate predictions from the model.
\item Many validation steps can also be \textbf{automated}.
\item We also allow \textbf{continuous monitoring and retraining} by collecting new data and storing it in the feature store.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{\underline{MONITORING AND TESTING}}
\section{Test cases developed}
\fontsize{12pt}{10pt}\selectfont
The complete development pipeline includes three essential components, data pipeline, ML model pipeline, and application pipeline. In accordance with this separation we distinguish three scopes for testing in ML systems: tests for features and data, tests for model development, and tests for ML infrastructure.[Figure \ref{fig_TestingCycle}]\\
\Large{\textbf{Features and Data Tests}}\\
\fontsize{12pt}{10pt}\selectfont
\begin{itemize}
\item\textbf{Data validation:} Automatic check for data and features schema/domain.
        Action: In order to build a schema (domain values), calculate statistics from the training data. This schema can be used as expectation definition or semantic role for input data during training and serving stages.
\item Features importance test to understand whether new features add a predictive power.
\begin{enumerate}

      	\item Action: Compute correlation coefficient on features columns.
        \item Action: Train model with one or two features.
        \item Action: Use the subset of features “One of k left out and train a set of different models.
        \item Measure data dependencies, inference latency, and RAM usage for each new feature. Compare it with the predictive power of the newly added features.
        \item Drop out unused/deprecated features from your infrastructure and document it.

    \item Features and data pipelines should be policy-compliant (e.g. GDPR). These requirements should be programmatically checked in both development and production environments.
    \item Feature creation code should be tested by unit tests (to capture bugs in features).

\chapter{\underline{CONCLUSION}\\\large{(Anticipatory approach)}}
In this project, we looked at developing an MLOps framework. The great thing about this is that we can plug tools into this framework as we find suitable tools. It also really helps with assessing new tools, as we can understand how they fit into our framework and any existing tooling. \vspace{5.0mm}

Over the next few months, I plan to put this into practice. I’m going to try out new tools, link them together and try to get a genuine MLOps environment on my home workstation. If you have experience with any of the tools mentioned in this, leave a comment!
